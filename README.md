# Bootstrap

## Intro

Bootstrap is a framework created by Twitter which allows us to use its large database to simplify the process of giving a page its appearence.

This exercice aims at teaching us Bootstrap so that we can use it to speed up the front end side of ùaking a website.

## The mission

We need to create a repository called restaurant-css-framework in which we add our html, css and js files. 

We chose to make a pretend website for The Prancing Pony, a famous fictionnal inn which comes from The Lord of the Rings.

Our website aims to be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It shall at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

### Welcome
A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).

### Menu
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

This was renamed Bill of Fare to fit a more midieval time frame.

### Pictures
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

### Restaurant
A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

### Contact
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.
